Algorithm/Approach	Description

Linear Regression	A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the data.

Logistic Regression	Similar to linear regression but used for binary classification problems, where the output is a categorical variable with two classes.

Decision Trees	A tree-like model where decisions are made based on the features of the data, often used for classification and regression tasks.

Random Forest	An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

Support Vector Machines	A supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks, particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and with complex datasets.

k-Nearest Neighbors	A simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression, where new data points are classified based on the majority class of their neighbors.

Clustering (e.g., K-means)	Unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together into clusters, often used for customer segmentation and pattern recognition.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)	Dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance as possible.

Neural Networks	Deep learning models inspired by the structure of the human brain, used for complex pattern recognition tasks, such as image and speech recognition.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)	Techniques for analyzing and processing human language data, used for sentiment analysis, text classification, and language translation, among others.
